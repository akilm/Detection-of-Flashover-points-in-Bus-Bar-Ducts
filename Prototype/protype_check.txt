Working procedure:
•	The output of the three microphones need to be connected to A0 , A1 and A2 pins on the arduino.  
•	Microphone connected to A0 is A,A1 is B and A2 is C .
•	A , B and C must be connected in the same order . 
•	The distance between (A ,B) and (B,C) must be 50 cm .
•	Open the serial monitor , generate sounds and then send any character from the serial monitor
	To obtain the approximate flashover point

This is the actual code for the proposed model of flashover point prediction .
it collects data continuously from the 6 analog pins and sends the data to 
web server specified only when an interrupt signal that is a character 's' is
sent back to it . the code for the main server and the gsm module is still under
progress . it will be updated in this same repository once done
